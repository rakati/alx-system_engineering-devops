## Explanation of Elements:

### Firewalls:
Three firewalls are added for security purposes. They control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules, protecting the servers from unauthorized access and potential threats.

### SSL Certificate (HTTPS):
An SSL certificate is used to encrypt traffic between the users' browsers and the web servers (Nginx), ensuring secure communication and protecting sensitive data during transmission.

### Monitoring Clients:
Three monitoring clients (data collectors) are included to monitor the performance, availability, and security of the web infrastructure. They collect data on various metrics such as server health, response times, error rates, and security incidents.

## Specifics about the Infrastructure:

### Firewalls:
Firewalls are essential for enforcing security policies, preventing unauthorized access, blocking malicious traffic, and ensuring compliance with security standards.

### HTTPS Traffic:
Serving traffic over HTTPS (encrypted) ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, safeguarding user information and preventing eavesdropping or tampering during transmission.

### Monitoring:
Monitoring is used to detect and diagnose issues, track performance trends, identify potential vulnerabilities, and ensure the overall health and reliability of the web infrastructure.

### Data Collection:
Monitoring tools collect data by periodically querying servers for metrics, analyzing logs, and using agents or probes to monitor system resources and network traffic.

### To monitor your web server's QPS effectively:
configure metrics collection for QPS monitoring, set thresholds and alerts based on server capacity and traffic, monitor and analyze QPS trends alongside other performance metrics, and optimize and scale your infrastructure accordingly.

## Issues with This Infrastructure:

### Terminating SSL at Load Balancer Level
Terminating SSL at the load balancer level can be an issue as it exposes decrypted traffic within the internal network, potentially compromising data security if the internal network is compromised.

### Single MySQL Server for Writes:
Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes can be a single point of failure (SPOF) for write operations.

### Identical Server Components:
Having servers with identical components (database, web server, application server) might lead to resource underutilization or inefficiencies if the workload distribution is not balanced or optimized across servers. It's important to design the infrastructure based on workload requirements and scalability needs.
