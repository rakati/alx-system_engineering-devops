### Server Overview:

A server is a computer system that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

### Domain Name (foobar.com):

The domain name, in this case, foobar.com, is a human-readable address that users can use to access your website instead of typing the server's IP address directly.

### DNS Record Type:

The DNS record type for www.foobar.com is an A record, which maps the domain name to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8 in this case).

### Web Server (Nginx):

The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests from users' web browsers and serves static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and routes dynamic requests to the application server.

### Application Server:

The application server runs your code base (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby) and processes dynamic requests sent by the web server. It interacts with the database to retrieve and manipulate data as needed.

### Database (MySQL):

The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data, such as user accounts, content, and settings. It communicates with the application server to handle database operations.

### Communication Protocol:

The server uses HTTP/HTTPS protocols to communicate with users' computers when they request access to the website. HTTPS ensures secure communication by encrypting data exchanged between the server and the user's browser.

## Issues with This Infrastructure:

### Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

Since all components (web server, application server, database) are hosted on a single server, any failure in the server can lead to downtime for the entire website.

### Downtime During Maintenance:

Performing maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server, may result in downtime, impacting user access to the website.

### Scalability Limitations:

This infrastructure may struggle to handle a significant increase in incoming traffic, as a single server has limited resources and processing power.
